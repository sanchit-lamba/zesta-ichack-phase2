# Team Zesta - Theme Computer Vision for the ICHack2.0 Phase-2 MUJ 
## (Problem Statement 2) - Advanced Autonomous Vehicle(AV) Self Driving System
#### Technolgies/Softwares/Non-Standard libraries used: 
   - CARLA (Open Source AV Simulator)
   - Keras (To implement Deep Learning Models)
   - Tensorflow (To train the model weights)
   - Pygame (To enable the model to imitate human-like input to the simulator)
   - OpenCV (To fetch and display/manipulate the data collected from virtual senors, videlicet, RGB Camera, LiDAR, Collision Detector)
